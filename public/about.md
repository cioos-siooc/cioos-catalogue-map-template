# About the OGSL Catalogue Map

The OGSL Catalogue Map is a web application designed to help users explore and visualize oceanographic datasets from the OGSL (Observatoire global du Saint-Laurent) catalogue. The interactive map interface allows users to filter, search, and view geospatial data related to a variety of ocean variables, such as water temperature, phytoplankton, and more. By clicking on map markers, users can access detailed dataset information, including descriptions, data producers, and direct links to the OGSL catalogue and downloadable files.

This tool is intended for researchers, decision-makers, and the general public interested in discovering and accessing ocean data for the St. Lawrence region. The application supports multiple languages and provides a user-friendly experience for navigating complex scientific data.
