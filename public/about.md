# About the Catalogue Map

The Catalogue Map of the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) is a web application designed to help users explore and visualize oceanographic datasets from CIOOS. The interactive map interface lets users filter, search, and view geospatial data related to a variety of ocean variables, such as water temperature, phytoplankton, and more. By clicking on map markers, users can access detailed information for each dataset, including descriptions, data providers, and direct links to the CIOOS catalogue and downloadable files.

This tool is intended for researchers, decision-makers, and the general public interested in discovering and accessing ocean data across Canada. The application supports multiple languages and offers a user-friendly experience for navigating complex scientific data.
